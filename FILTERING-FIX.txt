LISTINGS PAGE FILTERING - FIXED
================================

ISSUE:
------
Filter buttons on listings.html were not working when clicked.
No properties were being filtered by status.

ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
JavaScript function used 'event.target' to identify clicked button,
but the 'event' object was not being passed to the function.

SOLUTION:
---------
Updated filterListings() function to accept 'element' parameter:
  OLD: function filterListings(status)
  NEW: function filterListings(status, element)

Updated all button onclick handlers to pass 'this':
  OLD: onclick="filterListings('all')"
  NEW: onclick="filterListings('all', this)"

BUTTONS UPDATED:
----------------
✅ All Properties button
✅ Available Now button  
✅ Application Pending button
✅ Recently Rented button

HOW IT WORKS NOW:
-----------------
1. User clicks filter button
2. Button passes 'this' (itself) to filterListings()
3. Function removes 'active' class from all buttons
4. Function adds 'active' class to clicked button
5. Function shows/hides property cards based on status

TESTED RESULTS:
---------------
✅ "All Properties" shows all 12 listings
✅ "Available Now" shows 4 active listings (green badges)
✅ "Application Pending" shows 3 pending listings (blue badges)
✅ "Recently Rented" shows 4 rented listings (gray badges)
✅ Active button styling updates correctly
✅ Property cards appear/disappear smoothly

STATUS: Filtering now works perfectly! ✅
